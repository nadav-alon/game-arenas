# Game Arenas

A demo to demonstrate the theoretical concept of [Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_game).
It mostly exists for me to practice the concept and try to gain a better intuition, as well as to try to visualize them.


## What are games?

Games are computational object that allow 2 participants to participate in a match, in which there is a winner.
They are used to model reactive systems and other similar multi-agent activities. The games are infinite, which means they can model systems that dont nessecerily terminate.
